# Jasmine's Professional Frontend Developer Portfolio

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal professional portfolio, built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. The site is designed to showcase my expertise in modern frontend development, UI/UX principles, and complex API integration.

It is a fully responsive, single-page application (SPA) focused on clarity, performance, and accessibility.

## 💡 Key Features and Highlights

The portfolio highlights proficiency in several critical areas, including:

- **Responsive Design:** Implemented a mobile-first approach using Tailwind's utility classes.
- **Web3 Integration:** Showcase project demonstrating interaction with the **MetaMask API** and **Web3 libraries**.
- **API Consumption:** Experienced in handling asynchronous state and integrating with RESTful and conversational APIs (e.g., Dialogflow).
- **Clean Component Architecture:** Structure emphasizes reusable components (`Navbar.jsx`, `Projects.jsx`, etc.) for maintainability.
- **Form Handling:** Setup for serverless form submission using [Formspree/Netlify Forms]. (Specify which one you chose)
